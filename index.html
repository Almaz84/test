    <h3>Colors</h3>
    <p>CSS supports a wide variety of colors. These include named colors, like blue, black, and limegreen, along with colors described by a numeric value. Using a numeric system allows us to take advantage of the whole spectrum of colors that browsers support. In this lesson, weâ€™re going to explore all the color options CSS offers.</p>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <p>Some of the most important information a user will see on a web page will be textual. Styling text to make page content accessible and engaging can significantly improve user experience.</p>

    <div class="box model">
      <h3>Box model</h3>
      <p>Browsers load HTML elements with default position values. This often leads to an unexpected and unwanted user experience while limiting the views you can create. The box model is an important concept to understand how elements are positioned and displayed on a website.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="display and positioning">
       <h3>Display and positioning</h3>
       <p>A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS from left to right, top to bottom, in the same order as they exist in the document. This is called the flow of elements in HTML. In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that change how a browser positions elements. These properties specify where an element is located on a page, if the element can share lines with other elements, and other related attributes.</p>
